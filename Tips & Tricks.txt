HEAP
- Kth largest - use Min heap
- Kth smallest - use Max heap

Dynamic Programming

- Use Recursion when you can choose something
- If choice then Recursion and try Dynamic
- Use DP when - Choose something + optimal or maximum 
- Either Memoization or Top down approach
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Recusrion + Storage = DP
- Choice Diagram
- Base Condition : Think about smallest valid i/p
- DP should call the recursive function with value less than prev value
- Memoization : Create matrix for which values are changing : for us - w and size 
- Top down : Matrix
- Complexity of both are almost same
- Drawback in Memoize is - it keeps on calling function so stack get full

Greedy
- Fractional Knapsack
